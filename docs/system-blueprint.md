# SOC 5 Outbound — System Blueprint

## 1. System Purpose

SOC 5 Outbound is a real-time linehaul request management system for Shopee Sorting Facility Dispatch.

The system replaces the manual Google Sheets workflow with a role-aware dashboard for creating, approving, assigning, docking, confirming, and tracking truck requests through their full lifecycle.

## 4. Request Lifecycle

### Normal Flow

1. Ops PIC creates truck request.
2. Request status becomes PENDING.
3. FTE Ops reviews the request.
4. FTE Ops approves, edits, or cancels the request.
5. Once approved, request is routed to FTE MM.
6. FTE MM assigns truck plate number.
7. Once assigned, request is routed to Doc Officer.
8. Doc Officer encodes Driver ID and LH Trip Number.
9. Doc Officer actions the truck as docked.
10. Request status becomes DOCKED.
11. Printable image becomes available (this is already applied no need to revise)

### Rejection Flow

1. FTE MM rejects the approved request.
2. Request status becomes REJECTED_BY_MM.
3. Request goes back to FTE Ops.
4. FTE Ops may edit, cancel, or approve again.

---

## 5. Request Statuses

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| PENDING | Created request waiting for FTE Ops checking |
| APPROVED | Approved by FTE Ops and routed to FTE MM |
| CANCELLED | Cancelled request |
| REJECTED_BY_MM | Rejected by FTE MM and returned to FTE Ops |
| ASSIGNED | Truck plate number assigned by FTE MM |
| FOR_DOCKING | Routed to Doc Officer for docking confirmation |
| DOCKED | Truck marked as docked |
| CONFIRMED | Final confirmed request with Driver ID and LH Trip Number |

---

## 6. Event-Driven Actions

Every major action must create an event record.

Events:
- REQUEST_CREATED
- REQUEST_APPROVED
- REQUEST_EDITED
- REQUEST_CANCELLED
- REQUEST_REJECTED_BY_MM
- TRUCK_ASSIGNED
- TRUCK_FOR_DOCKING
- TRUCK_DOCKED
- REQUEST_CONFIRMED
- USER_CREATED
- USER_UPDATED
- USER_DISABLED

Purpose:
- Realtime routing
- Audit trail
- KPI tracking
- Notification sound trigger
- Debugging and traceability

---

## 7. Alert Notification Rules

Sound alert should trigger when:

| Event | Alert Receiver |
|---|---|
| REQUEST_CREATED | FTE Ops |
| REQUEST_APPROVED | FTE MM |
| REQUEST_REJECTED_BY_MM | FTE Ops |
| TRUCK_ASSIGNED | Doc Officer |
| TRUCK_FOR_DOCKING | Doc Officer |
| REQUEST_CONFIRMED | FTE Ops and FTE MM |

Frontend behavior:
1. Listen for realtime changes.
2. Check current user role.
3. Show toast notification.
4. Play alert sound.
5. Refresh affected table.

- Docking Confirmation
- KPI
- User Management

Reusable Components:
- Sidebar
- Topbar
- StatusBadge

## 15. Development Rule

This project must be built phase by phase.

No random coding.
No skipping database design.
No exposing Supabase service keys to frontend.
No plain text passwords.
No direct frontend write access to protected database operations.
